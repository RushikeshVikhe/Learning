Question 1:
i need to take clone of 1 repo but in repository i have 3 branches, i need to take a clone particular branch on my local machine, how can we do that?
Answer - 
git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo_url>
Example:

git clone -b my-branch git@github.com:user/myproject.git
With Git 1.7.10 and later, add --single-branch to prevent fetching of all branches. Example, with OpenCV 2.4 branch:

git clone -b opencv-2.4 --single-branch https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git


Question 2:
Encryption vs encoding - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-encryption-and-encoding/
Secrets are used to store sensitive information, like passwords or keys.
They’re similar to ConfigMaps, except that they’re stored in an encoded format.
Secrets are not encrypted. They’re only encoded, meaning anyone can look up the file that you created for Secrets, or get the secret object and then decode it using different methods available.

Question 4:
if you have s3 bucket in one account and another s3 bucket in another account, if you want to replicate all object from one bucket to another, how to do it?
Copying objects from one bucket to another in the same account is simple. You must log in to AWS CLI using the Account credentials and create two buckets in the same account. Upload objects in one bucket, and for copying them to the other target bucket in the same account, run the following command:
aws s3 sync s3://SOURCE_BUCKET_Name s3://DESTINATION_BUCKET_name
However, copying objects across S3 from one account to another is quite tedious. The entire process is described in the below diagram/below link.
Install aws cli on ec2 instance:
use- aws configure to configure credentials
aws s3 ls    .....cmd to get list of all s3 buckets
aws s3 sync s3://SOURCE_BUCKET_Name s3://DESTINATION_BUCKET_name
other way to replicate in same account- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-s3-cross-region-replication/

S3 Replication — Same-region or cross-region, must enable versioning
